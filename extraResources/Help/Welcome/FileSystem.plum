Each node is a '".plum"' file in your computer. These plain-text files can be opened on most text editors just like a regular '".txt"' file.

The hierarchy is generated by using the structure on the selected project folder.

To create a new Node press [u='Ctrl+N']. Check "'As child node'" to go lower in the current node hierarchy.
