[h1=Anonymous Containers:]
As you might have guessed, Anonymous Containers don\'t have names or ids. Something like this:
[cd='[=Hi, I don\'t have a name :(]']
[box=[=Hi, I don\'t have a name :(]]
You might be wondering what\'s the point of Anonymous Containers then\?
The thing is, you don\'t only need containers to reference them later. Just been a container will indicate the program that this is a special unit, and in conjunction with [[.@Welcome@WritingNotes@Attributes]^Attributes], plum can use the container delimitations to know how to apply attribute functionality.
Check [[.@Welcome@WritingNotes@Attributes]^Attributes] for more information.
