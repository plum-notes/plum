# Plum Notes

Plum Notes is a software application for organizing and taking notes. It uses its own markup-like language that integrates some scripting utilities, useful for more technical annotations or notes with some special functionality.


In 2023, I announced and launched a beta version of this product. However, after it didn't receive much attention, I chose to pause the project. Recently, after much consideration, I decided to make the project open source, believing this might be a more suitable direction for it.
